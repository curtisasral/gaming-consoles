<p align="left" style="font-size:25px">The Xbox was the first home gaming console made by Microsoft, named after the DirectX team from Microsoft that designed it. The original Xbox controller was super chunky and heavy, and was reviewed by gaming critics as "Blunder of the year", and one even criticized it as the second worst gaming controller ever made. The Xbox, like the Gamecube, ran its games off of discs, so storage was on the disc rather than the actual Xbox, which only had 8-10GB of storage.
